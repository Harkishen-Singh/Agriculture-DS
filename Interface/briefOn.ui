Highly refined statistical techniques in agriculture are now being used to extract information from past data and to project prediction values of economic variables. To a large extent, these advances in the science of harvest forecasting have been made possible by progress in IT technology. But, solitary statistical techniques do not provide perfect future situation. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze correlating monitoring crop environments with statistical information about harvest. It is expected that from Data science &amp;amp; analytics -based decision support system, this information on statistical pattern of crop can be obtained. The purpose of this study is to improve the agricultural forecast supporting information system, so that real-time forecast will be possible . To this end, it will be needed to manage IoT devices and gather information on them more appropriately. The IoT sensor based agricultural production System consists of three parts: relation analysis and statistical prediction. This system is designed an agricultural decision support system to predict crop growth by monitoring periodically using the IoT sensor technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The proposed system is compared with ON/OFF controller and it is shown that ON/OFF Controller based System fails miserably because of its limitations of time delay it can’t give appropriate value within specified time. On the other hand ANN based approach has resulted in possible implementation of better and more efficient control .This paper depends on different types of parameter like root level , wind direction, soil saltiness etc. for more efficient decision. These controllers do not require a prior knowledge of system and have inherent ability to adapt to the changing conditions unlike conventional methods. It is noteworthy that ANN based systems can save lot of energy and water and can provide optimized results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The proposed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based controller have prototyped using MATLAB .The procedure of irrigation is described in two ways open loop controller and closed loop controller both the ways uses physical parameter for the purpose of irrigation. Input parameters like temperature , humidity ,wind speed and radiation which directly influence the procedure of irrigation which is expressed by the Penman method is updated by FAO .The control unit consist of artificial neural network which which supervises the amount of water which should be supplied in order to optimized the whole system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

R.Revathi :- This paper explained an irrigation system using microcontroller, GSM module and a moisture sensor, which helps in providing an effective and reliable irrigation system. The system was built with single chip 80C51 module and GTM900C GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) module. The major objectives of the proposed system are low cost and effective with less power consumption using sensors for remote monitoring and controlling devices which are controlled via SMS using a GSM module. The system works with a GSM FLYSCALE SIM900 module and Arduino Uno microcontroller and a moisture sensor. The command signals from the user are obtained as messages from the user by the GSM module. This GSM module converts the message into hexadecimal code so that the microcontroller could process it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Control of this agro-bot will be wireless. Design and analyze a real time system for these robot give a solution and proposed a model which can be used in real time field. the robot Analyzed the design of plough tool and developed for real time system. The robotic system is built using high torque DC motor, communication module, relay driver circuit, Battery package, microcontroller. The mechanical parts of the robot are designed with the help of Pro-E Design Software. By the help of this type of robot the author tried to minimize some problem in agriculture field .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The systems mentioned in this paper are active in achieving the purpose of collecting sensor data and storing them over server . The in-built features of MySQL servers, namely Triggers Delimiters, using these features of MySQL, expected data ranges can be specified in the database table. The collected data from all the nodes are collected, this information is transmitted to a local base station (ATmega 128) through multi-hop transmission. API for the Internet of Things that enables users to collect, store, analyze, visualize, and act on data from sensors or actuators. Here author created a ThingSpeak channels store data sent to them from apps or devices. API keys enable users to write data to a channel or read data from a private channel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The proposed device can be readily used in practice in the Hydroponics environment and has great potential for other applications like green house agriculture, vertical farming. The CEA’s System provides automated control and monitoring program . This proposed work offer ease of use, effective and reliable control system. The proposed system is modelled using Arduino development kit which connects to light sensor measuring the light intensity, environment temperature/humidity sensor for getting the and humidity in the surroundings, soil moisture sensor for volumetric water level, and air toxicity measuring carbon monoxide and oxygen levels. The results obtained from the device have indicated that the performance is well, especially in collecting, logging and analyzing the sporadic data from the sensors that is transferred to central node for farmers’ use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The concrete FMIS has to focus on the needs of medium-sized and multifunctional farms. FMIS accurately display all branches of the farm at hand, so that the newly developed FMIS represents a valuable tool for the farmer to successfully manage the farm. The main objective of this paper is planning , organizing ,monitoring , controlling . The authors reviewed historical and contemporary literature to analyze different general ISs. The analyzed case study farm is a good example of such a complex farm structure. the case-study farm has three major braches, namely “Plant Production”, “Services” and “Livestock Production”. The branch “Plant Production”. The case-study farm emphasizes on an easy adaptation, user-friendliness, and accuracy in depicting the various production processes and services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ardunio is used for the coding .The microcontroller senses the signal by the help of OP AMP comparator which acts as a interface between the sensing arrangements and the microcontroller . This system keep track of the both temperature and humidity of the soil which provide the detail data about the requirement of the field . This leads to a enhanced irrigation process and reducing the pressure of the farmer .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</string>
